The mean is often used as a measure of central tendency when the dataset is normally distributed.\n",

This is because in a right-skewed dataset, the tail of the distribution extends to the right, indicating that there are a few very large values that pull the mean towards the right. As a result, the mean is typically higher than the median, which is the value that separates the lower 50% of the data from the upper 50%.

    "\n",
    "Covariance measures the degree to which two variables vary together. It is a measure of the joint variability of two random variables, and it is sensitive to the units of measurement. Covariance can be positive, indicating that the two variables tend to move in the same direction, or negative, indicating that they tend to move in opposite directions. However, it does not tell us the strength or direction of the relationship.\n",

    "Correlation, on the other hand, measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It is a standardized measure, which means that it is not affected by the units of measurement. Correlation can range from -1 to +1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative relationship, +1 indicates a perfect positive relationship, and 0 indicates no relationship at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistical analysis, both covariance and correlation are used to understand the relationship between two variables. However, correlation is generally preferred over covariance because it is standardized and easier to interpret. Correlation is also used to identify trends, make predictions, and develop models in regression analysis. Covariance is used less frequently, but it can still be useful in certain situations, such as portfolio analysis in finance.\n",
